        "One probable reason why spaCy might be getting confused and providing a misleading similarity score is that the pretrained word vectors used by spaCy, such as the en_core_web_md model, may not adequately capture the semantics and nuances of the given sentences. The pretrained vectors are trained on a large corpus of text, but they might not have specific information about the context or domain of the sentences being compared. Although in our case all the features we are looking for is available in en_core_web_md pretrained model, such as the word embedding vectors, text1 and text2 sentences vocabulary, euclidian norm and so on. For these reasons one may say there is no reason for spacy to be confuse. Let see how true this assertion is.\n",

The first sentence expresses a personal preference for specific types of food, while the second sentence makes a general statement about the taste of fast food. SpaCy's similarity score is based on word vectors and may not be able to accurately capture the overall meaning and intent of the sentences.\n",
        "## How spacy does this:\n",
        "spacy focuses on the patterns of word co-occurrences and the context in which words appear together,then assign a vector represntation to each word in the corpus or sentence. The closer words, are assigned a vector similar to each other. 1 shows a very high similiarity and 0 represent no similarity between the two words.\n",

        "The resulting similarity_score is a float value between 0 and 1, where 1 indicates high similarity and 0 indicates no similarity.\n",
